## 🎯 Final Recommendation

**For this Speech-to-Text application, we recommend Render** because:

1. **File Upload Support**: Better handling of audio files
2. **Processing Time**: No timeout limitations for transcription
3. **Cost Effective**: More generous free tier for API usage
4. **Reliability**: No cold starts affecting user experience
5. **Scalability**: Easy to upgrade as your needs grow

However, if you're building a frontend application that calls this API, consider using Vercel for the frontend and Render for the API backend.
